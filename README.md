# ✈️ Delayed Flights Analysis (Python + Power BI)

This project explores and visualizes **flight delay patterns** to understand the main causes and trends affecting airline punctuality.  
It combines **data cleaning in Python** with **interactive dashboards in Power BI**.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
Performed in `delayed_flights.ipynb` using:
- **Pandas** for data wrangling
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- Handling missing values, removing outliers, and feature engineering

---

## 📊 Dashboard (Power BI)
The Power BI dashboard visualizes:
- Total flights vs delayed flights per airline
- Average delay time by airport and airline
- Delay trends over time (monthly)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Power BI**
- **Google Colab**

---

## 📁 Files Included
-  `delayed_flights.ipynb` → Python data cleaning
